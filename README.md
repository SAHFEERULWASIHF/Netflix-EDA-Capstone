# 🎬 Netflix EDA Capstone Project

This project explores the Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset using Python. It is part of my Data Science learning journey and aims to uncover trends in genres, content types, seasonal additions, and content age.

## 📁 Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle - Netflix Movies and TV Shows](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows)
- Records: ~7,800 titles with fields like `type`, `title`, `release_year`, `country`, `date_added`, etc.

## 🧠 Project Goal

> **Understand what types of content Netflix adds, trends across time, genres, and content age.**

### Tools Used
- **Pandas**
- **Seaborn**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## 📊 Key Insights

- 🎥 Netflix has more **Movies** than TV Shows (~70%).
- 🌍 Most content comes from **United States** and **India**.
- 🧓 Content is usually **recent** (within 3 years), but older titles are also added.
- 📅 Content is mostly added in **December**, **July**, and **October** — aligning with holidays.
